# Kernel difference 

- There is no `.TF` in the name of the `kernel folder`. Can use the `s9xxx-install.sh` command to install into `EMMC`, Can use `s9xxx-update.sh` to upgrade the version in `EMMC`, and use it independently without inserting a `TF-Card or USB`, (It can also be used in `TF-Card or USB` without writing into `EMMC`.) E.g: `5.9.8`
- The names containing `.TF` only be used in `TF-Card or USB`, and cannot be install/upgrade into EMMC. The `TF-Card or USB` must be used daily, E.g: `5.10.16.TF`
